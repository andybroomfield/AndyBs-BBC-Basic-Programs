BBC Basic Programs
==================

Andy Broomfield

A set of BBC Basic programs, mostly written back in the early 90's
on what at the time was the schools RM Nimbus network.

Recently redisovered on an old floppy, I've tried to run a few and
its been quite fun experincing old memories. 

Hopefully these might be of interest.

A task left for you is to find and edit the line which 'timed' the program
so it didn't run to quickly (for K=1 TO 10000:NEXT K) which was
common in the programming books to slow down programs. Depending
on if you use an emulator or an interpretor the programs can 
run either very slowly or very quickly! 

The programs where written for BBC Basic x86. There is a demo 
somewhere on the internet, and a windows version from
http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcwin/download.html
that in theory could run the programs. Theres also a page
http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcbasic.html here for other interpters
/ emulators.

I've left the .BBC file which is the source used for the above 
interpretors. I've also added where I found it a .BAS file which is a 
plain text version of the program listing. (There used to be a program that
could convert them, but I don't have that anymore).

Also should be possible to port these to other Basic dialects, so perhaps
these will be useful for those learning to Program (Raspery PI's etc...)

Have Fun!
